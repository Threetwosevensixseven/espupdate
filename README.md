# ESP Update
ESP8266-01 in-circuit firmware updater for the ZX Spectrum Next™.

## Caution
The `ESPUPDATE` dot command is still in [pre-alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Pre-alpha) development. I recommend not running it on your Spectrum Next yet, unless I ask you to help test. The [ESP-01](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) can never be [bricked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_(electronics)), but you might end up in a situation where you have to re-update it on your PC with a [USB adaptor](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_nkw=ESP-01+USB+open+smart&_sacat=0&LH_TitleDesc=0&_osacat=0&_odkw=ESP-01+USB+CH340G&LH_TitleDesc=0) or [breadboard](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/flashing-the-ESP-01-firmware-to-SDK-v2.0.0-is-easier-now/), and [the python program](https://github.com/Threetwosevensixseven/espupdate/blob/master/fw/ESP8266_FULL_V3.3_SPUGS/esptool.py). No big deal, but just be aware :)
